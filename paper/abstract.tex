Safety is one of the technological goals of the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) systems that require further research and investigation. The most common procedure to control a reactor is to insert or withdraw control rods. Recent studies on MSRs show that the excess reactivity at the beginning
of the operation is quite large for many refueling scenarios.
The current work introduces a reliable safety system based on control rods beside the online feed system to control the reactivity during normal operation in the \gls{SD-TMSR}. The full-core of the SD-TMSR is loaded by three different types of initial fissile materials: $^{233}$U, reactor-grade Pu, and transuranic (TRU) elements as initial fuel salt.
Five different absorber materials are applied to study the main neutronics and safety parameters in the SD-TMSR: B$_4$C-90, HfB$_2$, HfH$_{1.62}$, Eu$_2$O$_3$, and Gd$_2$O$_3$. We focus on the control rod design, absorption ability, integral and differential control rod worths, shutdown margin of absorber materials, and shadowing effects at steady state calculation.
We used SERPENT-2 Monte-Carlo code to calculate the reactivity worth and analyze the performance of this control system.
All absorber materials provide an adequate shutdown margin for the SD-TMSR core that initially loaded by $^{233}$U and reactor-grade Pu. However, for TRU case, the shutdown margins are negative or slightly positive, this makes the SSD clusters ineffective to shut down the reactor loaded by TRU.
