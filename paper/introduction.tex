\section{Introduction} \label{Introduction}

The \gls{GIF} \cite{doe2002technology} determined six innovative reactor 
systems for further research and commercialization: the Very High-Temperature Reactor (VHTR), the \gls{MSR}, the 
Supercritical Water-Cooled Reactor (SWCR), the Gas-cooled Fast Reactor (GFR), 
the Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor (SFR), and the Lead-cooled Fast Reactor (LFR). 
The MSR is the only liquid-fueled reactor among these reactors. Major nuclear 
centers are pursuing MSRs with renewed interest \cite{betzler_impacts_2019, 
ashraf2020whole,betzler2016modeling,mohsin2019safety,zhang2020radiotoxicity} since
the MSR is a promising technology because of its dynamics, especially for 
thorium fuel utilization. However, this technology has difficulties in safety, 
online reprocessing, and fuel handling. Safety is one of the primary goals of 
the MSR system, and the SD-TMSR, in particular, requires further investigation to support a licensing case.
The unique characteristics of the MSR (liquid fuel, flux level, neutron economy, 
etc.) strongly affect its control system design. Doppler effect and thermal expansion of the fuel reduce
core reactivity when the core heats up, thus, graphite-moderated MSRs have 
a negative total temperature coefficient of reactivity 
\cite{ashraf2020whole,robertson_conceptual_1971,nuttin2005potential,rykhlevskii2019modeling,li_optimization_2018}.
MSR designs have drain tanks to 
hold and cool down the liquid fuel in an emergency. In most MSR design concepts, a freeze plug, which 
is located under the core, passively melts when the fuel temperature reaches a 
critical point, and drains the fuel salt from the reactor vessel to the drain 
tanks. The drain tanks have a subcritical
configuration with a large free 
surface area to readily dissipate heat by passive cooling 
\cite{elsheikh2013safety}.

At the Beginning of Life (BOL), MSRs are commonly loaded with more
fuel than that required to achieve criticality (necessary for long-term core 
operation); this leads to excess reactivity at the BOL. Recent studies on MSRs showed that this excess reactivity 
at the BOL is large for many refueling scenarios and may reach $\approx$ $8100$ $pcm$
\cite{rykhlevskii2019modeling,betzler2016modeling,ashraf2020Strategies,ashraf2018nuclear,ashraf2020whole,ashraf2019modeling}.
Additionally, during burnup, online reprocessing and refueling system helps to control the reactivity of 
the MSRs \cite{ashraf2020whole,ashraf2019Preliminary}. However, the most common and reliable procedure 
to control the reactor is to insert or withdraw control rods made of material 
with a large neutron absorption cross section (e.g., boron, cadmium) 
\cite{duderstadt650nuclear}. 
Insertion of control rods introduces negative reactivity into the 
core which helps to compensate the excess reactivity and 
adjust the power level of the core or shut down the reactor in case of 
emergency \cite{glasstone1967nuclear}. Therefore, we should estimate 
the reactivity worth of the control rods 
\cite{varvayanni2009estimation,fadaei2009control,aoyama2007core,bretscher1997computing}.
 The reactivity worth of control rods correlates with the interference 
(shadowing effects) between control rod clusters 
\cite{girardin2008development,vcerba2017optimization}. 
The control rod worth and its efficiency to absorb excess positive reactivity is a subject of major interest since it directly affects reactor safety \cite{liu2018criticality,atkinson2019small,vcerba2017optimization,do2019criticality,guo2019advanced,varvayanni2009estimation}.

Boron carbide (B$_4$C) is a commonly used material for the control rods 
\cite{zhong2019preliminary,steinbruck2010degradation,dunner1984absorber}; 
however, we may need to enrich the boron isotope ($^{10}$B) to reach 
the necessary absorption cross section. Additionally, issues related to helium gas release through (n,$\alpha$) reactions of $^{10}$B, high loss of the absorption ability under irradiation, and swelling limit the B$_4$C lifespan 
\cite{guo2019optimized}. Guo (2019), Gosset (2017), and Rudy (2011) summarized the properties of the 
potential alternative absorbers for Generation-IV reactors such as 
hafnium-based materials and rare earth oxides. These absorbers have 
high thermal conductivity, good resistance to neutron irradiation, and
absorb neutrons mainly through (n,$\gamma$) reactions
\cite{guo2019optimized,gosset2017absorber,konings2011comprehensive}.

The SD-TMSR with a thermal power of 2,250 MW$_{th}$ 
\cite{ashraf2020whole,li_optimization_2018} is a graphite-moderated 
molten salt reactor. Adjusting fertile and fissile feed rates helps to control the reactivity of 
the SD-TMSR \cite{ashraf2020whole,ashraf2020Strategies,li_optimization_2018}. However, a reactivity control system for maneuvering and emergency shutdown in the SD-TMSR has not been introduced in the literature \cite{li_optimization_2018,zou2018transition,zhang2020radiotoxicity,jiang2012advanced,zou2018preliminary,ZOU2015114}. Therefore, the main objective of our study is to introduce a new, 
rapid reactivity control system based on control rods in the SD-TMSR to control 
the reactivity during normal operation and shut down the reactor in case of 
emergency. Six absorbing material options are considered in the context of the 
neutronics and safety parameters in the SD-TMSR. We 
focus on control rod design, absorption ability, integral and differential 
control rod worths, shutdown margin, and shadowing 
effects at steady state calculation.

Xuemei \emph{et al.} (2013) calculated the control worth in the thorium molten salt
reactor by using MCNP5 \cite{briesmeister2000mcnptm}. We adopted the SD-TMSR
core geometry optimized by Li \emph{et al.} \cite{li_optimization_2018} which
is different from the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor-like geometry by Mathieu \emph{et al.}
\cite{mathieu2006thorium} adopted by Xuemei \emph{et al.} \cite{xuemei2013study}.
Additionally, Xuemei \emph{et al.} studied the natural B$_4$C as absorbing material
while we considered six different absorbing materials.

\v{C}erba \emph{et al.} (2017) designed a reactivity control system for the 
GFR. They utilized the MCNP5 and KENO6 codes 
\cite{petrie1984keno} to calculate the reactivity worth and analyze the 
performance of this control system \cite{vcerba2017optimization}. Since no
geometry design of the control rods system is available for the SD-TMSR, 
\v{C}erba's methodology \cite{vcerba2017optimization} helped us as a starting 
point of this analysis.

All calculations presented in this work are performed using Monte-Carlo code SERPENT-2 version 2.1.31 \cite{leppanen2014serpent}.
